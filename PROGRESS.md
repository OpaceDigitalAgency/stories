# Progress Log

## 2025-04-17
### Fixed: Clean-up tasks
- Deleted temporary files that are no longer needed:
  - stories-backend/direct_login.php
  - stories-backend/create_admin.php
  - stories-backend/update_admin_password.php
  - stories-backend/secure_system.php
  - stories-backend/admin/simple_login.php
- Replaced CDN links with local assets:
  - Downloaded and used local copies of CKEditor, Flatpickr, and Chart.js
  - Updated footer.php to use the local files instead of CDN links
- This completes all the required clean-up tasks

### Fixed: Ensure CRUD buttons work
- Verified that the Add, Edit, and Delete buttons are properly implemented in the generic list template
- Confirmed that the CrudPage class correctly handles CRUD operations with appropriate success messages
- Verified that after successful operations, the page redirects to the list page and shows a success message
- Confirmed that the delete button has the "delete-confirm" class, which shows a confirmation dialog before deleting
- This ensures that users can add, edit, and delete content with proper feedback

### Fixed: Fix media.php & CKEditor
- Verified that CKEditor is loaded from the correct URL: https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/35.0.1/classic/ckeditor.js
- Confirmed that CKEditor is properly whitelisted in the CSP (done in task 1)
- Verified that the media.php file is properly handling file uploads with good error handling
- Confirmed that the FileUpload class is properly handling file paths with trailing slashes
- This resolves the issues with the media.php page and ensures CKEditor works correctly

### Fixed: Send the JWT on every admin â†’ API request
- Updated the ApiClient.php file to include the JWT token from the session in all API requests
- Modified the request method to check for $_SESSION['token'] first, then fall back to the instance token if needed
- This ensures that the API receives proper authentication with every request
- This resolves the "API Errors" section in the dashboard and allows lists to populate with live data

### Fixed: Restore Font Awesome icons
- Created the webfonts directory at stories-backend/admin/assets/webfonts/
- Added required font files (fa-solid-900.woff2, fa-solid-900.woff, fa-solid-900.ttf) to the webfonts directory
- Updated header.php to use the local all.min.css file instead of loading from CDN
- This resolves the issue where icons were showing as colored blanks instead of proper glyphs

### Fixed: Retire the missing initDropdowns() helper
- Commented out the call to initDropdowns() in admin.js (line 57)
- This resolves the "initDropdowns is not defined" error that was occurring because the function was being called but wasn't properly defined
- The function was previously defined inside the showNotification() function, making it inaccessible from the global scope

### Fixed: Load jQuery + Bootstrap before dependent plugins
- Updated the script loading order in footer.php to ensure proper dependency chain:
  - jQuery is loaded first (jquery.min.js)
  - Bootstrap is loaded second (bootstrap.bundle.min.js)
  - Bootstrap Tags Input is loaded third (bootstrap-tagsinput.min.js)
  - Other scripts follow
- Updated Bootstrap Tags Input script to use the local file instead of loading from a CDN
- This resolves the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fn')" error that was occurring because plugins were trying to use jQuery before it was fully loaded

### Fixed: Unblock external scripts & styles (CSP)
- Updated the Content Security Policy in admin/.htaccess to allow external resources:
  - Added cdn.jsdelivr.net to style-src and script-src
  - Added cdnjs.cloudflare.com to style-src, script-src, and font-src
  - Added code.jquery.com to script-src
  - Added cdn.ckeditor.com to script-src
  - Added data: to img-src
  - Added 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' to script-src
  - Added https://api.storiesfromtheweb.org to connect-src
- This resolves CSP errors in the browser console that were blocking external scripts and styles

### Fixed: JavaScript Form Interception Issue
- Fixed the issue with JavaScript intercepting the login form:
  - The admin.js script was intercepting the login form submission because it had the "needs-validation" class
  - The script was trying to handle the form via AJAX and expected a JSON response
  - Since login.php returns HTML, this caused the "Unexpected token '<'" error
  - Removed the "needs-validation" class from the login form to prevent JavaScript interception
  - This allows the form to submit normally and the PHP redirect to work properly

### Fixed: Password Hash Issue in Database
- Fixed the issue where the password hash in the database was a placeholder and didn't match any actual password:
  - Created update_admin_password.php script to generate a proper hash for "Pa55word!" and update the database
  - Updated create_admin_user.sql to delete existing admin user and insert a new one with the correct hash
  - Modified create_admin.php to use the same approach
  - This ensures that the standard login flow works with the credentials:
    - Email: admin@example.com
    - Password: Pa55word!

### Fixed: Simplified Login Page
- Created a simplified login page that doesn't rely on external resources:
  - Created simple_login.php with inline CSS styles
  - Removed all external JavaScript and CSS dependencies
  - Modified login.php to redirect to simple_login.php
  - This provides a reliable login experience even with strict Content Security Policy settings

### Fixed: Content Security Policy for Login Page
- Fixed the login page not loading properly due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions:
  - Updated the CSP in admin/.htaccess to allow loading resources from external CDNs
  - Added the following domains to the allowed sources:
    - cdn.jsdelivr.net (Bootstrap CSS and JS)
    - cdnjs.cloudflare.com (Font Awesome)
    - code.jquery.com (jQuery)
  - This resolved the CSP violations that were preventing the login page from functioning correctly

### Fixed: Login Authentication Issue
- Fixed the issue where the main login page (admin/login.php) always returned "Invalid credentials" while direct_login.php worked:
  - Identified the root cause: The users table either had no admin user or had an admin user with a plaintext password instead of a proper bcrypt hash
  - Created a solution with three components:
    1. Created a SQL script (create_admin_user.sql) to insert or update an admin user with a properly hashed password
    2. Created a PHP script (create_admin.php) to execute the SQL and create/update the admin user with a proper bcrypt hash
    3. Created a security script (secure_system.php) to remove the direct_login.php backdoor and protect the admin/includes/ directory
  - Created comprehensive documentation (LOGIN_FIX.md) explaining the issue, root cause, and solution
  - The fix ensures that the main login system works correctly with the credentials:
    - Email: admin@example.com
    - Password: Pa55word!

  - Fixed Features dropdown functionality:
    - Added a dedicated initDropdowns() function to properly initialize all dropdowns
    - Added specific handling for the Features dropdown
    - Ensured the function is called when the DOM is loaded

### Fixed: AdminPage.php Syntax Error
- Identified and fixed a critical syntax error in the AdminPage.php file:
  - Found that the getSessionSuccess() method was not properly closed
  - Discovered that several methods (setPageDescription, addBreadcrumb, helpTooltip, formField) were incorrectly nested inside getSessionSuccess()
  - Fixed the method nesting by properly closing getSessionSuccess() and moving the other methods outside of it

  - Updated config.php to make the configuration available globally with `$GLOBALS['config'] = $config;`
  - Enhanced media configuration to ensure the uploads directory exists with proper permissions
  - Added better error handling and debugging to the FileUpload class
  - Modified the AdminPage class to ensure configuration is properly accessible to child classes
  - Set proper permissions (755) on the uploads directory
