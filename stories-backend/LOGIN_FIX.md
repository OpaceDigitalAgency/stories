# Login System Fix Documentation

## Issue

The main login page (`admin/login.php`) was returning "Invalid credentials" while `direct_login.php` was working. This document explains the root cause and the solution implemented.

## Root Cause Analysis

The authentication flow in the main login page follows this path:
```
admin/login.php → Auth::login() → Auth::authenticate()
```

The `authenticate()` method performs these checks:
1. Queries the users table for a user with the given email and active=1
2. Verifies the password using `password_verify()`
3. Checks if the user's role is admin or editor

The issue was that:
- Either the users table was empty (no admin user existed)
- Or an admin user existed but with a plaintext password instead of a proper bcrypt hash

The `direct_login.php` file worked because it bypassed the password verification step by directly setting the user in the session after finding them in the database.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented the following solution:

1. Created a script (`create_admin.php`) to:
   - Check if an admin user exists
   - If it exists, update its password with a proper bcrypt hash
   - If it doesn't exist, create a new admin user with a proper bcrypt hash

2. Created a security script (`secure_system.php`) to:
   - Remove the `direct_login.php` backdoor
   - Create an `.htaccess` file to protect the `admin/includes/` directory
   - Ensure the logs directory exists with proper permissions

## Login Credentials

After running the fix, you can log in with:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: Pa55word!

## Security Recommendations

1. Delete the following files after use:
   - `create_admin.php`
   - `create_admin_user.sql`
   - `secure_system.php`
   - `direct_login.php` (should be removed by the secure_system.php script)

2. Change the admin password after the first login to something unique and secure.

3. Regularly review user accounts and ensure proper password hashing is used for all accounts.

## Technical Details

### Password Hashing

The system uses PHP's `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` functions for secure password management. The hash used in the fix was generated with:

```php
password_hash('Pa55word!', PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
```

This produces a bcrypt hash that looks like:
```
$2y$10$8AobgFUdBaUKoeBkFxfRgeIod6CVuToAfM0c/niIXv3LhyCd9cCIu
```

### Authentication Flow

The proper authentication flow is:
1. User submits email and password
2. System retrieves user by email
3. System verifies password hash
4. System checks user role
5. If all checks pass, user is logged in and session is created

### Database Schema

The users table has the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('user', 'author', 'editor', 'admin') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user',
    active TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that the main login system works correctly by providing a properly hashed password for the admin user. It also improves security by removing the backdoor login method and protecting sensitive directories.
